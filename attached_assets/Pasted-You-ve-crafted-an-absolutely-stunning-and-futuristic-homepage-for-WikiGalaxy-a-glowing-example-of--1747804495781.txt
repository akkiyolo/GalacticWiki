You've crafted an absolutely stunning and futuristic homepage for WikiGalaxy — a glowing example of modern web design done right! From the sleek search bar to the interstellar theme, every detail feels like a journey through a cosmic library. ✨🌌

Now let’s take this project to new galaxies!

🌠 Goal:
Create two new pages for the WikiGalaxy website — an About page and a Contact page. Both pages must follow the same space-inspired, animated, 3D exotic design as the homepage. Use visually engaging effects like floating planets, rockets, satellites, and starfields across the site.

🌌 About Page:
Design a stylish, animated "About" page featuring a galactic background with cosmic elements (e.g., animated stars, planets slowly orbiting, rocket trails). Make the layout immersive and use futuristic fonts and glows.

Include this text content:
