## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1.  A user enters a search term into the search bar on the frontend.
2.  JavaScript captures the input and sends an API request to the Python backend.
3.  The Python server receives the request and uses the `wikipedia.summary()` function to get the article summary.
4.  The backend then sends this summary back to the frontend as a response.
5.  Finally, JavaScript receives the summary and displays it dynamically on the page for the user to read.
